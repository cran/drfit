     Report metadata for a specified substance from a specified
     database, and plot the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

       checksubstance(substance,db="cytotox",experimentator="%",celltype="%",enzymetype="%",whereClause="1",ok="%")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

substance: The name of the substance identifying it within the
          database.

      db: The database to be used. Currently, the databases "cytotox"
          and "enzymes" of the UFT Department of Bioorganic Chemistry
          are supported (default is "cytotox").

experimentator: The name of the experimentator whose data is to be
          used. Default is "%", which means that data from all
          experimentators are shown.

celltype: Currently, only data for IPC-81, C6, NB4, HeLa, Jurkat and
          U937 are supported. Default is "%", i.e. data for any cell
          type will be displayed.

enzymetype: Currently, only data for AChE, GR and GST are supported.
          The default value is "%", i.e. data for any enzyme type will
          be displayed.

whereClause: With this argument, additional conditions for the SQL
          query can be set,  e.g. "where plate != 710". The default is
          1 (in SQL syntax this means TRUE).

      ok: With the default value "%", all data in the database is
          retrieved for the  specified substance.
