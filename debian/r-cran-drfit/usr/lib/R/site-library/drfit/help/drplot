_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Produce graphics of dose-response data and dose-response
     relationships  either combined or separately, for one or more
     substances.

         postscript, png, bw, pointsize, colors, devoff, lpos)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

drresults: A data frame as returned from 'drfit'. 

    data: A data frame as returned from 'drdata'. The data frame has to
          contain at least a factor called "substance", a vector called
          "unit" containing the unit used for the dose, a column
          "response" with the response values of the test system
          normalized between 0 and 1, a column "dose" with the numeric
          dose values and a factor called "dosefactor" containing the
          dose as a factor.  

   dtype: A string describing if the raw data should be plotted
          ("raw"), or an error bar should be constructed from the
          standard deviations of the responses at each dose level
          ("std", default value) or from the confidence intervals
          ("conf"). If you don't want to see the data, set it to
          "none". 

   alpha: The confidence level, defaulting to 0.95, only used if dtype
          "conf" has been chosen. 

    path: The path where graphic files should be put if any are
          produced. Defaults to "./" i.e. the current working directory
          of R. 

fileprefix: A string which will form the beginning of each filename, if
          graphic files are  created. Defaults to "drplot". 

 overlay: If TRUE, all output will be put into one graph, otherwise a
          separate graph will be created for each substance. In the
          latter case, on-screen display (postscript=FALSE) only works
          correctly for data plots. Dose-response models will all be
          put into the last graph in this case. 

postscript: If TRUE, (a) postscript graph(s) will be created.
          Otherwise, and if  the png argument is also FALSE, graphics
          will be displayed with a screen graphics device. 

     png: If TRUE, (a) png graph(s) will be created. Otherwise, and if
          the postscript argument is also FALSE, graphics will be
          displayed with a screen graphics device. 

      bw: A boolean deciding if the plots will be black and white or
          not. Default  is TRUE. 

pointsize: The pointsize used for png and postscript graphics. 

  colors: This is a vector of colors, defaulting to 1:8, used for
          plotting the data. 

    lpos: An optional argument defaulting to "topright" specifying the
          position of the legend by being passed to the legend
          function. See the help for the legend function for all
          possiblities.

  devoff: If set to FALSE, the closing of the device after creation of
          an overlay png or postscript graph will be left out, so texts
          and other elements can be  added to the graph. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

 results: You will get plots of data and/or the fitted dose-response
          curves, on the screen and/or as postscript files, depending
          on the parameters. 

_N_o_t_e:

     Be sure all devices are closed (e.g. by calling 'dev.off()')
     before calling 'drplot' again after a failure.
