	* Make drcfit compatible with drc >= 3.0.1 (the row names of the matrix
	returned by the ED() function were changed).
	* Switch back to using requireNamespace(RODBC) in order to address 
	a NOTE issued by R CMD check
	* Use single quotes to quote other packages in the DESCRIPTION file

	* Use require(RODBC) instead of requireNamespace(RODBC) as the former fails
	with the message that rodbcConnectDriver is not found

	* Suggest RODBC instead of depending on it, as it is not available
	  on all CRAN check systems.

	* Adress various NOTES given by R CMD check

	* DESCRIPTION: New verson 0.6.3

	* inst/test: Reduced precision in pyrithione.R as results were
	platform dependent. Updated all .Rout.save files

	* inst/doc/index.html: Make the index contain valid html. Thanks to
	Kurt Hornik for checking HTML validity in CRAN packages.

	* DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE: New verson 0.6.1, with the drc package as
	dependency. Import needed functionality to avoid masking standard functions.

	* R/drcfit.R: Add function drcfit() that imitates the functionality of
	drfit(), but internally uses the methods supplied by the drc package

	* R/{drfit,drcfit}.R: Return the list of fitted models in an attribute of
	the resulting dataframe. Deal with the case of only NA values in the unit 
	column of the data.

	* R/drfit.R: Use the fitted nls() models directly to calculate EDx values

	* R/drplot.R: Use different point characters (pch) for the data, and add the 
	possibility to specify them using the argument pchs. Also make drplot() work
	for the results from the drcfit function.

	* man/drcfit.Rd: Document the above

	* tests/drcfit.R: Add some tests for this new functionality

	* man/{antifoul,IM1xIPC81,IM1xVibrio}.Rd: Add more example code including
	the use of drcfit().

2014-02-03  Johannes Ranke

	* DESCRIPTION: New version 0.5-97 (leading zeros in version numbers are
	deprecated), modernize author field, enable lazy loading

	* Add this ChangeLog, a GNUMakefile, and an .Rbuildignore file

	* R/*.R: Clean out unnecessary calls to library() and require()

	* R/*.R: Tell R (>2.15.1) about some undeclared global variables to avoid NOTES in
	package checks

	* R/drfit.R: Add the argument showED50. If set to TRUE, drfit includes the
	ED50 and its confidence interval on the original scale in the output

	* R/drfit.R: Add the possibility to calculate several EDx values for each
	dose-response model

	* man/drfit.Rd: Update the documentation and use the new optional arguments
	in the example
